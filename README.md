Investigating Early Stages of the COVID-19 Outbreak

Many reports have indicated that older individuals experience more severe symptoms of COVID-19; 
in response, this project explores the relationship between age and survival status of COVID-19 patients. 
The impact of additional factors, including gender, the country of origin, whether patient is from Wuhan,
and whether the patient has visited Wuhan, is also explored in this project. The data frame is taken from 
the early stages of the pandemic, specifically 1085 observations from 1/20/2020 to 2/15/2020, in which each 
observation is a case of a patient who tested positive for COVID-19.

To gain insight into possible associations between survival status and the above-mentioned variables, statistical methods 
including bootstrap confidence intervals, two-sided hypothesis testing, and logistic regression were employed. 
The results show that age did bear impact on the survival status of the patient. The gender of the patient 
and whether they lived in Wuhan did also seem to influence the survival status of the patient, but on a smaller scale.
